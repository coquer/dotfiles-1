# Dotfiles

I use this to configure these applications:
 - Xorg
 - i3-gaps
 - polybar
 - bash
 - vim

This repo makes my dotfiles publicly available and gives me version control. Feel free to copy and alter.
The makefile will add symlinks to these files where needed.
You can do this with a quick 
```
make install
```
If there are existing files, they are backed up.
